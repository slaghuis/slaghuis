- 🌱 I’m currently learning robotics using the ROS2 framework.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ways to apply autonomous dtone flight for commercial gain.  (Help on my code would also be appreiated.  I have built some stuff that I could not find on the internet, so I think there is some value in what I am doing)
