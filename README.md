- 👋 Hi, I’m Eric Slaghuis, or as my Github friends call me, @slaghuis
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things. Currently I am interested in Robotics, especially how an automomous drone can be valuable to industry. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning robotics using the ROS2 framework.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ways to apply autonomous drone flight for commercial gain.  (Help on my code would also be appreiated.  I have built some stuff that I could not find on the internet, so I think there is some value in what I am doing)  
- 📫 Why don't we start a chat.
